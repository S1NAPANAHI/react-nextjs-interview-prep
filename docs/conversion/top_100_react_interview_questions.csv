1,What is React and why would you use it?,"React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It uses a component-based architecture, Virtual DOM for efficient updates, and follows a declarative programming paradigm. Key benefits include reusable components, better performance through Virtual DOM, strong community support, and excellent developer tools.",Beginner,React Fundamentals
2,What is JSX and how does it work?,"JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It makes React components more readable and easier to write. JSX gets transpiled by tools like Babel into React.createElement() calls. Example: <div>Hello World</div> becomes React.createElement('div', null, 'Hello World').",Beginner,React Fundamentals
3,What is the Virtual DOM?,"The Virtual DOM is a lightweight JavaScript representation of the actual DOM. React creates a virtual copy, compares it with the previous version when changes occur (diffing), and updates only the changed parts in the real DOM (reconciliation). This makes updates much faster than manipulating the DOM directly.",Beginner,React Fundamentals
4,What's the difference between props and state?,"Props (properties) are immutable data passed from parent to child components - they're read-only. State is mutable data owned by a component that can change over time, typically in response to user actions or network responses. Props enable data flow down the component tree, while state manages local component data.",Beginner,React Fundamentals
5,What are React components? Functional vs Class components?,"Components are reusable, self-contained pieces of UI. Functional components are JavaScript functions that return JSX and use hooks for state/lifecycle. Class components extend React.Component and use lifecycle methods and this.state. Functional components are now preferred due to hooks, cleaner syntax, and better performance.",Beginner,React Fundamentals
6,Why are keys important in React lists?,"Keys help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed in lists. They provide stable identity for each element, enabling efficient updates and preventing rendering bugs. Keys should be unique and stable - avoid using array indexes when list items can change order.",Beginner,React Fundamentals
7,What is useEffect and when do you use it?,"useEffect is a Hook that lets you perform side effects in functional components (data fetching, subscriptions, DOM manipulation). It runs after render and can optionally clean up. The dependency array controls when it runs: [] runs once, [value] runs when value changes, no array runs every render.",Beginner,React Hooks
8,What are controlled vs uncontrolled components?,Controlled components have their value controlled by React state - the component's value comes from state and updates through event handlers. Uncontrolled components manage their own state internally and are accessed via refs. Controlled components are recommended for predictable data flow and easier validation.,Beginner,React Fundamentals
9,What are React Hooks and name the common ones?,"Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Common hooks include: useState (state management), useEffect (side effects), useContext (context consumption), useRef (DOM access), useMemo (memoization), useCallback (function memoization), useReducer (complex state logic).",Intermediate,React Hooks
10,How do you handle events in React?,"React uses SyntheticEvents, which are wrappers around native DOM events providing consistent behavior across browsers. Event handlers are named using camelCase (onClick, not onclick) and are passed as functions. Events are automatically bound in functional components, but need binding in class components.",Beginner,React Fundamentals
11,What is the Context API and when should you use it?,"Context API provides a way to pass data through the component tree without prop drilling. Create a context with React.createContext(), provide values with Provider, and consume with useContext hook or Consumer. Use for truly global data like themes, authentication, or language settings - avoid overuse as it can make components harder to test.",Intermediate,State Management
12,What is prop drilling and how can you avoid it?,"Prop drilling is passing props through multiple component levels just to reach a deeply nested child. It makes code harder to maintain. Avoid it using: Context API for global state, custom hooks for shared logic, state management libraries like Redux, or component composition patterns.",Intermediate,State Management
13,Explain useState hook with examples,"useState adds state to functional components. Returns an array: [currentValue, setterFunction]. Example: const [count, setCount] = useState(0). State updates are asynchronous and merge (objects) or replace (primitives). For state dependent on previous value, use functional updates: setCount(prev => prev + 1).",Beginner,React Hooks
14,What is useRef and when do you use it?,"useRef returns a mutable ref object whose .current property persists across renders without causing re-renders. Used for: accessing DOM elements directly, storing mutable values that don't trigger re-renders, keeping references to timers/intervals, or storing previous state/props values.",Intermediate,React Hooks
15,How do you optimize React component performance?,"Use React.memo for functional components to prevent unnecessary re-renders, implement useMemo for expensive calculations, useCallback for stable function references, lazy loading with React.lazy and Suspense, proper key props in lists, avoid inline objects/functions as props, and use React DevTools Profiler to identify bottlenecks.",Intermediate,Performance
16,What are React Fragments and why use them?,Fragments let you group multiple children without adding extra DOM nodes. Use <React.Fragment> or shorthand <> </>. Helpful when a component needs to return multiple elements but you don't want wrapper divs cluttering the DOM structure or affecting CSS styling.,Beginner,React Fundamentals
17,How do you handle forms in React?,"Use controlled components where form data is handled by React state. Each input has a value prop from state and onChange handler to update state. For complex forms, consider useReducer or libraries like Formik/React Hook Form. Always validate input and handle submission properly with preventDefault().",Intermediate,Forms
18,What is lifting state up?,Moving state from child components to their closest common ancestor so multiple components can share the same state. The parent manages state and passes it down as props along with update functions. This ensures single source of truth and synchronized data across components.,Intermediate,State Management
19,How do you implement conditional rendering?,"Use JavaScript expressions within JSX: ternary operator {condition ? <ComponentA /> : <ComponentB />}, logical AND {condition && <Component />}, if-else statements before return, or early returns. Choose based on readability and complexity of conditions.",Beginner,React Fundamentals
20,What are the rules of hooks?,"1. Only call hooks at the top level of React functions, never inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. 2. Only call hooks from React function components or custom hooks. 3. Always call hooks in the same order. These rules ensure hooks work correctly with React's internal state management.",Intermediate,React Hooks
21,What is useMemo and when should you use it?,"useMemo memoizes expensive calculations, recomputing only when dependencies change. Use for computationally intensive operations that don't need to run on every render. Example: const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]). Don't overuse - memoization has overhead.",Intermediate,React Hooks
22,What is useCallback and when should you use it?,"useCallback memoizes functions to prevent recreation on every render. Useful when passing callbacks to optimized child components that depend on reference equality. Example: const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => doSomething(a, b), [a, b]). Helps prevent unnecessary child re-renders.",Intermediate,React Hooks
23,What is useReducer and when would you use it over useState?,"useReducer manages complex state logic through actions and reducers, similar to Redux. Use when: state has multiple sub-values, next state depends on previous one, complex state transitions, or when you need more predictable state updates. Better than useState for complex state logic.",Intermediate,React Hooks
24,How do you create custom hooks?,"Custom hooks are JavaScript functions starting with 'use' that can call other hooks. They extract component logic into reusable functions. Example: function useCounter(initialValue) { const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue); const increment = () => setCount(count + 1); return { count, increment }; }",Intermediate,React Hooks
25,What are Higher-Order Components (HOCs)?,"HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional props or behavior. Used for cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, or data fetching. Example: const withAuth = (WrappedComponent) => (props) => isAuthenticated ? <WrappedComponent {...props} /> : <Login />",Advanced,Advanced Patterns
26,What are render props?,A technique for sharing code between components using a prop whose value is a function. The component calls this function instead of implementing its own render logic. Example: <DataProvider render={(data) => <DisplayComponent data={data} />} />. Provides flexibility in what gets rendered.,Advanced,Advanced Patterns
27,What are error boundaries?,"Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors in their child component tree, log errors, and display fallback UI. Implemented using componentDidCatch and static getDerivedStateFromError in class components. They don't catch errors in event handlers, async code, or during SSR.",Advanced,Error Handling
28,What is React.lazy and Suspense?,React.lazy enables dynamic imports for code splitting. Suspense provides fallback UI while lazy components load. Example: const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent')); <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}><LazyComponent /></Suspense>. Improves initial load performance.,Advanced,Performance
29,What are React Portals?,"Portals render children into a DOM node outside the parent component's hierarchy. Useful for modals, tooltips, dropdowns that need to escape parent overflow/z-index constraints. Example: ReactDOM.createPortal(child, document.getElementById('modal-root'))",Advanced,Advanced Concepts
30,What is forwardRef and when do you use it?,"forwardRef allows passing refs through components to child elements. Useful for library components that need to expose DOM elements to parent components. Example: const MyInput = forwardRef((props, ref) => <input {...props} ref={ref} />)",Advanced,Advanced Concepts
31,Explain React's reconciliation process,"Reconciliation is React's algorithm to determine what changes need to be made to the DOM. It compares (diffs) the new virtual DOM tree with the previous one, identifies minimal changes needed, and efficiently updates the real DOM. Uses heuristics like component type and keys for optimization.",Advanced,React Internals
32,What is React Fiber?,"React Fiber is a complete rewrite of React's core algorithm for better performance and new features. It enables incremental rendering, pause/abort/resume work, priority-based updates, and time-slicing. Allows React to break rendering work into chunks and spread it over multiple frames.",Advanced,React Internals
33,What are synthetic events in React?,"SyntheticEvents are React's wrapper around native DOM events, providing consistent API across different browsers. They have the same interface as native events but work identically across all browsers. Events are pooled for performance - use event.persist() if accessing asynchronously.",Intermediate,Events
34,How do you handle asynchronous data fetching in React?,"Use useEffect for side effects, manage loading/error states with useState, handle cleanup to prevent memory leaks. Consider custom hooks for reusable logic, libraries like SWR/React Query for caching, and proper error boundaries. Example pattern: loading -> success/error states.",Intermediate,Data Fetching
35,What is React.memo and when should you use it?,"React.memo is a higher-order component that memoizes functional components, preventing re-renders when props haven't changed (shallow comparison). Use when component renders often with same props or parent re-renders frequently. Can provide custom comparison function as second argument.",Intermediate,Performance
36,How do you test React components?,"Use React Testing Library for user-centric testing, Jest for test runner, render components and interact with them as users would. Test behavior, not implementation. Mock external dependencies, use screen queries (getByRole, getByText), simulate user interactions with userEvent.",Intermediate,Testing
37,What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?,"Controlled: React controls the input value via state, value prop, and onChange handler. Single source of truth, predictable, easier to validate. Uncontrolled: DOM controls the value, accessed via refs, form data handled at submission. Less code but harder to validate dynamically.",Beginner,Forms
38,How do you optimize performance in large React applications?,"Use code splitting (React.lazy), memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback), virtualization for large lists, optimize bundle size, implement proper state management, avoid unnecessary re-renders, use production builds, monitor with React DevTools Profiler, consider SSR/SSG.",Advanced,Performance
39,What is the component lifecycle in class components?,"Mounting: constructor, componentDidMount. Updating: shouldComponentUpdate, componentDidUpdate. Unmounting: componentWillUnmount. Error: componentDidCatch. Each phase allows different operations - setup, cleanup, optimization, error handling. Hooks replace these in functional components.",Intermediate,Lifecycle
40,How do you handle state management in large applications?,"For local state use useState/useReducer. For global state consider Context API, Redux (predictable state updates), Zustand (lightweight), or Jotai (atomic state). Choose based on complexity: Context for simple global state, Redux for complex state logic, newer libraries for modern alternatives.",Advanced,State Management
41,What is Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in React?,"SSR renders React components on the server and sends HTML to the browser. Benefits: better SEO, faster initial page load, improved performance on slow devices. Implemented with frameworks like Next.js. Challenges: complexity, server resources, hydration mismatches.",Advanced,SSR/SSG
42,What is Static Site Generation (SSG)?,"SSG pre-renders pages at build time, generating static HTML files. Faster than SSR, better for SEO than CSR, great for content that doesn't change often.

43,How do you implement routing in React?,"Use React Router for client-side routing. BrowserRouter for history API, Routes/Route for path matching, Link/NavLink for navigation, useNavigate for programmatic navigation, useParams for route parameters. Handle nested routes, protected routes, and 404 pages.",Intermediate,Routing
44,What are React Design Patterns?,"Common patterns: Presentational/Container (separate logic from UI), Render Props (share code via function props), HOCs (enhance components), Custom Hooks (reusable stateful logic), Compound Components (components working together), Provider Pattern (context-based state).",Advanced,Advanced Patterns
45,How do you handle environment variables in React?,"Use REACT_APP_ prefix for custom environment variables in Create React App. Access via process.env.REACT_APP_VARIABLE_NAME. Store in .env files (.env, .env.local, .env.production). Never store secrets in React apps - they're visible to users.",Intermediate,Build & Deploy
46,What is the difference between React and other frameworks like Angular/Vue?,"React: Library focused on UI, flexible, large ecosystem, JSX, unidirectional data flow.
